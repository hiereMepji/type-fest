Unfortunately, Microsoft discontinued Encarta Kids in 2009, along with the rest of the Encarta products. You can no longer download it from Microsoft's website or access it online. However, you can still find it on some other web portals that offer free downloads of old software. Here are the steps to download Microsoft Encarta Kids 2009 for free:
 
1. Go to [this page](https://archive.org/details/encarta-2009) on the Internet Archive website[^1^]. This is a French version of Encarta 2009 that includes Encarta Kids.
2. Click on the "DOWNLOAD OPTIONS" section and choose "TORRENT". This will download a file called "encarta-2009\_archive.torrent".
3. Open the torrent file with a torrent client, such as [uTorrent](https://www.utorrent.com/) or [BitTorrent](https://www.bittorrent.com/). This will start downloading the Encarta 2009 files to your computer.
4. Once the download is complete, you will have a folder called "encarta-2009" that contains several files. The one you need is called "Encarta\_2009.iso". This is an image file that contains all the data of Encarta 2009.
5. To run Encarta 2009, you need to mount the image file as a virtual drive. You can use a software like [DAEMON Tools Lite](https://www.daemon-tools.cc/products/dtLite) or [PowerISO](https://www.poweriso.com/) for this purpose. Install one of these programs and follow the instructions to mount the image file.
6. After mounting the image file, you will see a new drive letter in your computer. Open it and double-click on the file called "autorun.exe". This will launch the installation wizard of Encarta 2009.
7. Follow the steps of the installation wizard to install Encarta 2009 on your computer. You may need to change the language settings to English if you don't want to use French.
8. Once the installation is done, you can access Encarta 2009 from your Start menu or desktop shortcut. To open Encarta Kids, click on the icon that says "EncyclopÃ©die Junior". Enjoy!
